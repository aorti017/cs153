*eveywhere cmd_line of equiv is used in strtok_r replace with a copy, execept for in setup_stack_helper, this is so setup_stack_helper 
gets the entire line without losing tokens to the other functions that reuire them
*if load and process-execute need two differtent parts of cmd_line have exec hold onto the copy that is having token removed, not the original that way
process_execute can get part 0 and load and get part 1
*helper code for syscalls uses what i think is a thred element for maitaing a pointer to the parent and the child process maybe
*make sure to validate user passed pointer for syscalls inside the handler
